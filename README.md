UBMP420 is a simple, versatile, and inexpensive microcontroller development system for anyone. The circuit board contains a variety of simple I/O devices on-board so beginners can learn to code and make an assortment of different projects using just the parts on UBMP420 – no breadboarding, shields, or other modules required.

UBMP420 was designed for learning or teaching PIC programming in C or assembly language using either Microchip’s MPLAB X IDE or their MPLAB Xpress Cloud-based IDE. The [USB µC bootloader](https://hackaday.io/project/63204-usb-c-usb-pic-bootloader) allows UBMP420 to appear as a mass storage drive for easy programming. Simply drag and drop a compiled .hex file onto the ***PIC16F1459*** drive and your program will start to run as soon as the file is transferred.

The bootloader makes it possible to program UBMP420 on on almost any kind of device, even enabling schools with 1:1 Chromebook programs to teach real C language microcontroller programming with Github integration.

## UBMP420 Hardware Features

- Microchip PIC16F1459 USB-capable microcontroller with 8k words of program FLASH (6k words free when using the USB µC bootloader), 128B of user FLASH, 1kB of RAM, 10-bit ADC, and a built-in temperature sensor
- 5 built-in pushbuttons
- 5 visible light LEDs
- 1 piezo beeper output
- optional 8-pin header for PORTC I/O pin expansion (great for servos, a SONAR module, NeoPixels, an LCD display, etc.)
- optional IR LED output for remote control transmitter applications (or a high-current transistor-driven output)
- optional IR demodulator for remote control decoding
- optional IR phototransistor or visible-light ambient light sensor for light sensing
- USB 2.0 type-C port for power and programming
- 6-pin ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) header for PICkit-4
